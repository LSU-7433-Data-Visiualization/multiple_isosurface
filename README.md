Multiple Isosurface Extraction of Scalar Volume Data

# Requirements
* Visualize scalar volume data using the Marching Cubes isosurface
extraction method
    * Download the input data “DataDensity” and Marching Cubes code
from the moodle
* Extract isosurfaces for multiple isovalues at the same time
    * Render them on different viewports
* Support a multi-resolution extraction scheme with
    * Isosurfaces for the selected isovalues rendered at high (original)
resolution
    * Isosurfaces for other isovalues rendered at one or more low (reduced) resolutions
* Provide the necessary user interactive options
